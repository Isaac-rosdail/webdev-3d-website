            <h2>A Fine Example for What Can Go Wrong</h2>
            <p>I've only been 3D printing for a month or so now, but I created this site to help others avoid these same aggravating
                problems I've run into myself. 3D printing can be almost as infuriating as it is incredible. <em>Practical</em>
                designs (or decorative!) can be dreamt up and breathed into existence, but only with the patience to suffer
                through the headache of troubleshooting the many things that can go wrong, or be improperly tuned. Clearly
                something went seriously wrong here with this poor guy here. As to what in particular that is, I'm not quite so
                sure, but as a fake journalist, my job here is to speak authoritatively about topics I don't fully
                understand. And as a lazy fake journalist, I'll just provide links to the following potential issues.</p>

            <h3>I Wish You All the Best of Luck!</h3>
            <p>Hopefully at least some of the info gathered in these articles helps you tune your printer to
                prevent masterpieces such as the one here. 3D printing <strong>(especially if you fell prey to reason 4)</strong> can
                be a <em>frustrating</em> process of trial and error. However, the results you can get from proper tuning, solid
                model design, and some patience are really outstanding, especially considering it's all done from the comfort
                of your own home (or shed, if you've got a smelly resin printer).</p>
